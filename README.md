# CoreAI

A group project applying artificial intelligence fundamentals to a chosen machine learning problem through a singular coursework task for *IN3062 – Introduction to AI*.

The project consists of:
* `data/` – a directory of the datasets used, see [Data](#data) for more.
* `src/` – a directory containing a single Jupyter Notebook describing the approaches taken and results observed.

## Data

The base dataset ([`emissions.csv`](https://github.com/m1younis/CoreAI/blob/master/data/emissions.csv)) can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kkhandekar/co2-emissions-1960-2018), and is originally retrieved from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC).

It collates CO2 emission figures (measured in tonnes per capita) for 266 countries from the year 1960 through to 2018, reflecting the effects of fossil fuel consumption and industrial processes over a relatively recent time period.
