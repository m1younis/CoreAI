A group project applying artificial intelligence fundamentals to a chosen machine learning problem through a singular coursework task for *IN3062 – Introduction to AI*.

The project consists of:
* `data` – a directory of the datasets used, see [Data](#data) for more.

## Data

The base dataset can be found at [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) by selecting the *"CO2 emissions per person"* indicator shown further down the page.
