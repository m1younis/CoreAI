# CoreAI

A group project applying artificial intelligence fundamentals to a chosen machine learning problem through a singular coursework task for *IN3062 – Introduction to AI*.

The project consists of:
* `data/` – a directory of the datasets used, see [Data](#data) for more.
* `models/` – a directory of visualized results.
* `src/` – a directory containing a single Jupyter Notebook describing the approaches taken and results observed.

## Data

The base dataset ([`healthcare.csv`](https://github.com/m1younis/CoreAI/blob/master/data/healthcare.csv)) was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).

It contains over 1000 records of anonymous individuals from the US on health insurance plans, recording additional information such as their age, gender and BMI value.
